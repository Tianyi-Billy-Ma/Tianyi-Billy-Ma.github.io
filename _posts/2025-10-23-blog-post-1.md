[Spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) is an open source toolkit that allows you to focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes instead of vibe coding every piece from scratch.
It comes with 5 stages and 7 commands to facilitate the development team to build production-level projects quickly and efficiently (Of course, integrated with Coding Agents like Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

- Spec-kit follows the specification-driven development (SDD) paradigm where specifications define the **what** before **how**. 
- Spec-kit Pros:
  - Executable, structured workflow
  - Task breakdown and incremental delivery
  - Active community and cadence
- Spec-kit Cons:
  - Process overhead for small tasks
  - Learning curve and change management
