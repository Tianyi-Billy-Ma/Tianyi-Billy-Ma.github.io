Greetings! I am excited to serve as a **research mentor** for the ND Summer Enrichment Program. The program is designed to provide high school students with an opportunity to engage in research projects with faculty and graduate students at the University of Notre Dame. I will work with a group of high school students to explore the exciting world of research in computer science and engineering. I am looking forward to sharing my research experience and helping students develop their research skills.

The program will run from **May 27th to July 26th, 2024.** I am excited to meet the students and work together on interesting research projects. Stay tuned for updates on our research journey!
