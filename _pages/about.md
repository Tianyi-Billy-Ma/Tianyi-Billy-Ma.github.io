Greetings! I am Tianyi (Billy) Ma (马天翊), a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, supervised by [Prof. Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). 
Under Prof. Ye's supervision, I collaborate with [my lab mates](http://yes-lab.org/students.html) and [Prof. Chuxu Zhang](https://chuxuzhang.github.io/).
Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree from the University of Southern California and my B.S. degree from the University of Colorado Boulder.

My research fields fail in graph/hypergraph Learning and its application with Large Language models. Specifically, I am interested in hypergraph representation learning and contrastive learning. **I am eager to collaborate with fellow researchers. Please feel free to contact me via the email provided below to discuss details.**
